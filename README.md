## Introduction

**MusicMatch** is a dynamic music event booking platform designed for the vibrant music scene in the UK. Built as a beginner Django project, MusicMatch focuses on enabling hosts to showcase their events while allowing users to easily book tickets. It leverages responsive design, CRUD functionality, and database management to deliver an intuitive and functional user experience.

MusicMatch was developed for educational purposes as part of my journey to learn Django and further my skills in full-stack web development using Python, Bootstrap frameworks, and AI tools such as Microsoft Co-Pilot and DALL-E.

## UX - User Experience

### Design Inspiration

The design was inspired by the thriving music culture of the UK and the need for a modern, clean interface for users to interact with the platform easily. The focus was on simplicity and functionality, ensuring users could find and book events with minimal effort. Using calming fonts (Poppins for headlines and Lato for body text) enhances readability and maintains a professional, welcoming aesthetic.

### Colour Scheme

The colour palette was selected to reflect the UK‚Äôs vibrant yet grounded music scene, inspired by the 1970s with a modern-day minimalist design approach.  
Key colours include:

- **Primary:** Calm green for navigation and background (`#c9dbba`)
- **Secondary:** Bright orange accents for calls to action (`#faa381`)
- **Tertiary:** Light green and white for clarity and contrast (`#75704e`)

## **Database Schema - Entity Relationship Diagram**

### **ERD Image**

![ERD for MusicMatch](#)  
_(Replace `#` with the link to your ERD image if hosted, or upload it here.)_

---

### **Overview**

The **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** for MusicMatch demonstrates the relationships between the various components of the application and how they connect to the underlying PostgreSQL database. It outlines how users, events, bookings, and profiles are interlinked.

MusicMatch leverages Django‚Äôs built-in `User` model for user authentication and authorization. When a user registers, a `user_id` is created, which acts as a unique identifier linking them to other key features such as creating and managing events, making bookings, and editing their profile. This ensures seamless data connectivity across the platform.

---

### **How It Works**

1. **User Authentication**:

   - Django's `User` model handles registration and login functionalities.
   - A `Profile` model is linked to the `User` model using a one-to-one relationship. This allows for role-based differentiation (e.g., `customer` or `event_holder`).

2. **Events and Bookings**:

   - Users with the `event_holder` role can create and manage `Event` entries.
   - Users (both `customers` and `event_holders`) can book tickets for events. The `Booking` model links users to specific events, with attributes like ticket count and booking time.

3. **Django Admin Panel**:
   - Administrators can view and manage all data, including events, profiles, and bookings, through Django‚Äôs Admin dashboard.
   - Data integrity is ensured with `on_delete=models.CASCADE`, meaning when a user is deleted, all their related data (e.g., events, bookings) is automatically removed.

---

### **Security**

A range of measures were implemented to protect user data and ensure the platform operates securely:

#### **1. CSRF Tokens**

- Every form submission includes CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens to validate requests and protect against unauthorized actions.

#### **2. Role-Based Access Control**

- The platform uses role-based logic to control user access:
  - Customers can book events but cannot create or edit them.
  - Event holders can create, update, and delete their own events.
  - Admins have full access to all content and user data.

#### **3. Defensive Design**

- **Input Validation**:
  - Forms validate user input to ensure data integrity and avoid errors.
- **Error Handling**:
  - User-friendly error messages and fallback pages guide users when issues arise.
- **Restricted Access**:
  - Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page when attempting to access restricted sections like event creation or bookings.

#### **4. Data Management**

- All user-generated content is tied to their `user_id`. Deletion of a user cascades and removes related data (e.g., bookings, events) to prevent orphaned records.
- Users can update or delete their profile information, but account deletion is currently unavailable. This will be included in a future release.

---

### **Future Development**

For future versions of MusicMatch, the following features will enhance its database schema and security:

1. **Payment Integration**:
   - Adding support for secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) to process event ticket purchases.
2. **Feedback System**:
   - Users will be able to leave reviews for events and organizers.
3. **Enhanced User Authentication**:
   - Integration with social login options (e.g., Google or Facebook) via Django AllAuth.
4. **Advanced Search Filters**:
   - Adding search options for events based on `music_genre`, `venue`, or `date`.

---

### **Acknowledgments**

The models for MusicMatch were developed using foundational Django concepts, with inspiration drawn from various learning resources:

- The **Code Institute** blog walkthrough provided a strong base for profile and booking models.
- Practical experimentation with Django‚Äôs `User` model and the `ForeignKey` and `OneToOneField` relationships allowed for more complex interactions between entities.
