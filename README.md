## Introduction

**MusicMatch** is a dynamic music event booking platform designed for the vibrant music scene in the UK. Built as a beginner Django project, MusicMatch focuses on enabling hosts to showcase their events while allowing users to easily book tickets. It leverages responsive design, CRUD functionality, and database management to deliver an intuitive and functional user experience.

MusicMatch was developed for educational purposes as part of my journey to learn Django and further my skills in full-stack web development using Python, Bootstrap frameworks, and AI tools such as Microsoft Co-Pilot and DALL-E.

## UX - User Experience

### Design Inspiration

The design was inspired by the thriving music culture of the UK and the need for a modern, clean interface for users to interact with the platform easily. The focus was on simplicity and functionality, ensuring users could find and book events with minimal effort. Using calming fonts (Poppins for headlines and Lato for body text) enhances readability and maintains a professional, welcoming aesthetic.

### Colour Scheme

The colour palette was selected to reflect the UK‚Äôs vibrant yet grounded music scene, inspired by the 1970s with a modern-day minimalist design approach.  
Key colours include:

- **Primary:** Calm green for navigation and background (`#c9dbba`)
- **Secondary:** Bright orange accents for calls to action (`#faa381`)
- **Tertiary:** Light green and white for clarity and contrast (`#75704e`)

### Fonts

- **Poppins:** A clean and modern sans-serif font for headlines.
- **Lato:** A versatile sans-serif font for body text, ensuring optimal readability.
